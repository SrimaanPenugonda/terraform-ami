create an instance using ami
this is to make an ami with inline commands executed so that it can be used for
roboshop project

this is for frontend -
create an instance - resource "aws_instance" "ami_instance"
resource "null_resource" "provisioner"  - provisioner for the above instance
it created seperatly to modify as required

 provisioner "remote-exec" {
 connection {}
 inline =[]

 Instance created but not able to connect and provision inline commands due to
 no security grp
 CREATE security grp
 resource "aws_security_group" "allow_tls"
 ingress{} inbound
 egress{} outbound
 attach the security grp to above instance
 vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.allow_ssh.id]

 now create AMI with above instance
 resource "aws_ami_from_instance" "example"

 -- Now if we give destroy.. AMI also get deleted
    lifecycle helps here to avoid delete
    create_before_destroy
    prevent_destroy
  terraform state rm aws_ami_from_instance.ami - to skip the AMI destroy, remove the
  ami from state file
    terraform destroy
    - this will destroy the instance,security grp but wont destroy the AMI
